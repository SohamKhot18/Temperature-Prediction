# 🌡️ Temperature Prediction Model

**Brief Objective:** Predict the Temperature based on Humidity using a machine learning model.

This project uses machine learning to predict temperature values based on historical weather data. The model is built using a Jupyter Notebook and trained on the `humidity.csv` dataset.
